# How To Contribute

“doc2dash” is always open for suggestions and contributions by generous
developers. I’ve collected a few tipps to get you started.

Please:

- Obey [PEP 8] and [PEP 257].
- *Always* add tests and docs for your code.
- Add yourself to the AUTHORS.rst file in an alphabetical fashion.
- Write [good commit messages].
- Ideally, [squash] your commits, i.e. make your pull requests just one commit.

Thank you for considering to contribute to “doc2dash”!
